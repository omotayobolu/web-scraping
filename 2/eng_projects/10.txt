Project link: https://project4topics.com/remote-monitoring-and-control-of-a-refrigerator-using-gsm-interface/ 
Project abstract: ABSTRACT The technology regarding controlling devices and circuits is developing at a faster pace day-by-day. This project has applications similar to the controlling devices. So, in the model, Arduino circuit is the main component which could serve in the functioning of the program designed. Up to date, at many places, the refrigerator management is very poor. There are a lot of failures in the development of refrigerator temperature management techniques. ...
