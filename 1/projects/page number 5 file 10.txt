Project title: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CAMPUS WIDE WIRELESS NETWORK 
Project Abstract: ABSTRACT This project embarks on a solution to wireless services in a campus. It proposes a new approach to support wireless mobile internet working on a large university campus or similar environment. The architecture of the approach combines wireless local-area network technology with high-speed switching technology. The combination provides a wireless communication system with sufficient aggregate bandwidth to handle massive, synchronized movements of mobile computers. Furthermore, the approach supports optimal ...
