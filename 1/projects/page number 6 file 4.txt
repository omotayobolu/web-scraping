Project title: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CORONAVIRUS DIGITAL CONTACT TRACING 
Project Abstract: Abstract The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems. Preventing further transmission is a priority. We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled ...
