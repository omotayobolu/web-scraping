Project title: COMPARATIVE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS OF LIPOXYGENASE OF SPECIES OF ASPERGILLUS AND FUSARIUM USING WEB-BASED BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS 
Project Abstract: CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND of study Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data. Bioinformatics is both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as a reference to specific ...
