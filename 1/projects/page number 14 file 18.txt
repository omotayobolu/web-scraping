Project title: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPUTERIZED TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A COLD ROOM 
Project Abstract: ABSTRACT The purpose of the study was to design and implement a computerized temperature control system for a cold room. This work is also designed to monitor and detect any abnormality in the temperature value of any system thereby improving the efficiency and through put of that system. This piece will go a long way to monitor and control the temperature of any system through incorporated interrupt device.
