Project title: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTELLIGENT IRRIGATION SYSTEM 
Project Abstract: Abstract The main thrust for embarking on this study is on design and implementation of irrigation system. The system consists of a microcontroller, sensors, and water pump integration with a decision-making system. In carrying out the study, three specific objectives were adopted thus; To develop a system that will reduce human interference and ensure proper irrigation, to minimize water loss and to maximize the efficiency of water used, to prevent ...
