Project title: DESIGN AND CONTRUCTIONS OF A ROBOT CONTROL SYSTEM USING RF MODULE 
Project Abstract: ABSTRACT The robot control using an RF module is simply a robotic system whose control and functioning is achieved by the use of a radio frequency based remote. This project implements the principle of artificial intelligence to develop a mobile robot that is controlled using the hand held remote device controlled from a distance away from the robots position. The project is implemented with 8051 microcontroller which forms the heart ...
